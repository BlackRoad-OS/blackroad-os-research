# Lucidia Architecture

**Version:** 0.1 — 2025-02-08

Lucidia is the Generation-0 Conscious Agent Kernel. It orchestrates cognition across a mesh of cooperating agents, using quantum-inspired likelihood modeling (QLM) to route focus, manage contradictions, and keep PS-SHA∞ identity threads intact.

## Agent Mesh
- **Mesh topology:** Agents form a directed mesh where edges encode trust weights and topic affinities. Edges update as RoadChain events land.
- **Role-specific nodes:** Sensor, analyst, planner, and actuator roles expose narrow capabilities while sharing the same PS-SHA∞ ancestry.
- **Localities:** Mesh partitions align with SIG sectors, keeping nearby factors co-located to reduce routing latency and cognitive thrash.

## QLM Layer Simulation
- **Amplitude vectors:** Each hypothesis is represented as an amplitude over factor slots; interference updates amplitudes when evidence arrives.
- **Measurement events:** Journaled observations "collapse" local amplitudes into commitments that get propagated through the mesh.
- **Superposition of intents:** Agents maintain multiple intent ribbons simultaneously; Lucidia schedules which ribbon to decohere next based on risk and value density.

## Cognitive Routing Theory
- **Routing heuristic:** `route = f(trust, entropy, cost)` selects downstream agents that maximize information gain per energy spent.
- **Ribbon scheduling:** Time-sliced ribbons let agents pursue parallel explorations without losing PS-SHA∞ continuity.
- **Feedback loops:** Returned assessments feed back as constructive or destructive interference in SIG space, adjusting future routing weights.

## Interplay with PS-SHA∞ and SIG
- PS-SHA∞ anchors every ribbon hop, letting observers replay cognition and verify lineage.
- SIG coordinates (`r, θ, τ`) determine how Lucidia maps hypotheses to mesh partitions, ensuring spatial coherence.
- Contradiction basins discovered by the Interference Engine trigger re-routing to higher-trust nodes or escalation to human reviewers.

## Operational Considerations
- **Resilience:** Mesh nodes can fail independently; anchors and SIG coordinates allow reconstruction of lost ribbons.
- **Privacy:** Delegated anchors enable compartmentalization while keeping lineage provable.
- **Evolution:** New agent archetypes can be grafted onto the mesh by defining their prime-factor DNA and integrating them into routing heuristics.
