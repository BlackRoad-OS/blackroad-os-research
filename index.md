# BlackRoad OS Research Index

This index collects the core theory, specifications, and experiments that form the research substrate for BlackRoad OS. Use it to navigate foundational SIG geometry, PS-SHA∞ identity mechanics, Lucidia orchestration theory, and supporting audits or simulations.

## Core Foundations
- **Spiral Information Geometry**
  - [SIG Overview](sig/sig-overview.md): defines the `(r, θ, τ)` spiral coordinate system, interference patterns, and factor-tree projection.
  - [SIG Overview (Paper)](papers/spiral-information-geometry/sig-overview.md): paper-style treatment of the spiral model with additional context.
  - [SIG Factor Tree](papers/spiral-information-geometry/sig-factor-tree.md): prime-factor DNA and tree mapping for agents on the spiral.
- **PS-SHA∞ Identity**
  - [PS-SHA∞ Definition](ps-sha-infinity/definition.md): identity-first hashing, worldline anchoring, and separation of identity vs. truth.
  - [PS-SHA∞ Overview (Paper)](papers/ps-sha-infinity/ps-sha-infinity.md): worldline journaling, chain properties, and audit motivations.
  - [PS-SHA∞ References](papers/ps-sha-infinity/references.md): supporting citations and related prior art.
- **Lucidia Kernel**
  - [Lucidia Architecture](lucidia/architecture.md): mesh-based Generation-0 agent kernel, QLM-inspired routing, and contradiction handling.
- **RoadChain Ledger**
  - [RoadChain Ledger Theory](roadchain/ledger-theory.md): event journaling, deterministic aggregation, and block formation aligned to PS-SHA∞.

## Glossary and Reference
- [Concepts](glossary/concepts.md): canonical definitions across SIG, PS-SHA∞, agents, and orchestration.
- [Symbols](glossary/symbols.md): symbol table for recurrent notation.
- [References](references/README.md): external citations and supporting resources.
- [Notes](notes/README.md): working notes and research stubs.
