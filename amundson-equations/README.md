# 🧬 Amundson Equations

> Unified math/physics/AI framework for BlackRoad OS.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Amundson Equations folder contains the **unified mathematical framework** that bridges:

- **Information geometry** (SIG spiral manifolds) 🌀
- **Identity mechanics** (PS-SHA∞ worldlines) 🔐
- **Cognitive dynamics** (agent state evolution) 🧠
- **Physical analogies** (energy, entropy, equilibrium) ⚛️

Named after the Norwegian polar explorer, these equations chart a path through the "mathematical ice" connecting disparate theoretical domains.

## 🔗 Core Equations (Preview)

### Spiral Evolution

The evolution of an agent's position on the SIG manifold:

```
d/dt (r, θ, τ) = f(K(t), A, σ)
```

Where:
- `K(t)` = knowledge state
- `A` = attractor field
- `σ` = capability strength tensor

### Identity Conservation

Identity is conserved across transformations:

```
∂I/∂t + ∇·J_I = 0
```

Where `J_I` is the identity current (hash chain propagation rate).

### Cognitive Energy

Total cognitive energy in an agent system:

```
E = Σᵢ (½m_i v_i² + U(r_i, A))
```

Where:
- `m_i` = "mass" (commitment inertia)
- `v_i` = spiral velocity
- `U` = potential energy from attractor field

## 📏 Development Notes

This framework is **speculative and under development**. Each equation should be:

1. **Motivated** – Why this form? What intuition supports it?
2. **Connected** – How does it relate to SIG, PS-SHA∞, and agent behavior?
3. **Testable** – What experiments could validate or refute it?

## ❓ Open Questions

1. Is there a meaningful "action principle" for agent evolution?
2. Can we derive SIG geometry from information-theoretic first principles?
3. What are the "symmetries" of the BlackRoad OS mathematical structure?
