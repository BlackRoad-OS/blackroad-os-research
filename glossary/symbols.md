## 🧬 Mathematical Notation

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes |
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| `K(t)` | Knowledge state of an agent or system at time `t` | Derived from accumulated PS-SHA∞ journal entries. |
| `C(t)` | Contradiction count or complexity score at time `t` | Increases when trinary conflicts emerge; used for escalation thresholds. |
| `λ` | Sensitivity factor | Tunes how quickly contradictions trigger escalation or quarantine. |
| `θ` | Spiral angular coordinate | Locates a factor or agent on the SIG manifold. |
| `r` | Spiral radial coordinate | Represents maturity or energy of a factor in SIG. |
| `τ` | Revolution counter | Counts full rotations (epochs) in SIG coordinate system. |
| `σ` | Capability strength score | Weighted confidence of an agent's ability to execute a capability. |
| `J` | Journal chain identifier | Associates entries to a PS-SHA∞ worldline for reconstruction. |
| `Φ` | Resolution operator | Chosen reconciliation strategy for contradictions (e.g., majority, priority). |
| `Δt` | Time delta between entries | Used to analyze cadence or drift in agent behavior. |
| `I` | Identity (agent) | Persistent cryptographic binding via PS-SHA∞. |
| `U` | Potential energy | Attractor field strength in Amundson equations. |
| `ρ_I` | Identity density | Concentration of identity anchors in state space. |
| `J_I` | Identity current | Rate of identity flow through state space. |
