# 🤖 Agents

> Theories of agent identity, behavior, and orchestration for BlackRoad OS.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder contains theoretical foundations for BlackRoad OS agents, including:

- **Identity Theory** 🔐 – How agents maintain persistent, verifiable identity across migrations, restarts, and federated meshes
- **Behavior Models** 🧠 – Cognitive architectures, decision-making frameworks, and state machines
- **Orchestration Theory** 🎼 – Multi-agent coordination, task routing, and conflict resolution patterns

---

| [agent-behavior.md](agent-behavior.md) | Cognitive models, belief systems, and decision architectures |
| [agent-orchestration.md](agent-orchestration.md) | Multi-agent coordination and task distribution theory |

## 📏 Note Structure Guidelines

Each note in this folder should answer:

1️⃣ **What is this concept?** (plain language explanation)  
2️⃣ **What is the formalism?** (equations, state machines, diagrams)  
3️⃣ **How does it map to code?** (interface sketches, type definitions)

## 🔐 Compliance Note

If any agent theory affects:
- Regulated identity verification
- Financial decision automation
- Audit trail requirements

Add a **COMPLIANCE HOOK** pointing to where policy constraints must be enforced in production repos.
