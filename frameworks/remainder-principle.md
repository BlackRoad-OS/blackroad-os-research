# Remainder Principle

## Core Statement

> "The deviation from symmetry IS the signal."

## Formalization
```
Information = Total Structure - Symmetry
```

Or equivalently:
```
Signal = What's Left After Cancellation
```

## Examples

| Domain | Symmetry | Remainder | Signal |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Modular forms | Transformation rules | Mock theta functions | Deeper structure |
| Quantum field theory | Gauge invariance | Anomalies | Physical constraints |
| Statistics | Expected value | Residuals | Model inadequacy |
| Cryptography | Randomness | Patterns | Vulnerabilities |
| Evolution | Fitness landscape | Mutations | Adaptation |

## Key Insight

**Perfect symmetry erases information.**

If everything cancels perfectly, nothing distinguishes one state from another. The *failure* to cancel—the structured remainder—carries the information.

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Z-Framework**: Z ≠ ∅ is a remainder
- **Creative Energy**: δ_t is structured remainder from coherence
- **n=π Duality**: The interface *is* the remainder of discrete↔continuous

## Applications to BlackRoad

1. **Agent Disagreement**: Preserve disagreement as signal, don't force consensus
2. **PS-SHA∞**: Discretization remainders contain identity continuity
3. **Coherence vs Consensus**: Coherence preserves remainder; consensus erases it

## Open Questions

- Can we quantify "structured failure" formally?
- What's the minimum remainder needed to preserve identity?
- How does remainder relate to Kolmogorov complexity?
