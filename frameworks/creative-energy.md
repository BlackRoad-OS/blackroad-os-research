# Creative Energy Formula

## Definition
```
K(t) = C(t) · e^{λ|δ_t|}
```

Where:
- **K(t)** = creative energy at time t
- **C(t)** = coherence (ability to direct creativity)
- **δ_t** = contradiction load (tension, paradox, conflict)
- **λ** = amplification constant

## Coherence Formula
```
C(t) = [Ψ'(M_t) + δ_t] / [1 + |δ_t|]
```

Where:
- **Ψ'(M_t)** = derivative of memory state (rate of integration)
- **δ_t** = contradiction load

## Interpretation

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| High δ, High C | Maximum creative output (focused intensity) |
| High δ, Low C | Chaos, fragmentation |
| Low δ, High C | Stability but stagnation |
| Low δ, Low C | Entropy, dissolution |

## Key Insight

**Contradictions fuel creativity exponentially.**

The e^{λ|δ_t|} term means small increases in contradiction produce large creative amplification—*if* coherence is maintained.

## Optimal Strategy

1. Introduce enough δ_t to amplify K(t)
2. Maintain C(t) to direct the energy
3. Balance at the edge of chaos

## Applications to BlackRoad

1. **Agent Creativity**: Measure and optimize K(t) per agent
2. **Contradiction Handling**: Don't resolve too quickly—harvest first
3. **Paraconsistent Logic**: Formalize δ_t tolerance

## Open Questions

- What is the optimal λ for different domains?
- Is there a maximum useful δ_t before breakdown?
- How does K(t) relate to information entropy?
