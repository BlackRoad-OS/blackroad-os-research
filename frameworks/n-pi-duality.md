# n=π Duality

## Core Claim

Integers (n) and π are dual descriptions of the same underlying structure.

| n (Integers) | π (Pi) |
|--------------|--------|
| Discrete | Continuous |
| Countable | Uncountable |
| Local | Global |
| Points | Frequencies |
| Counting | Symmetries |

## The Morphism

Fourier transform mediates between:
- Discrete coefficients (indexed by n)
- Continuous functions (involving π)
```
f(x) = Σ_n c_n e^{2πinx}
```

The n's label modes; π encodes the circular symmetry.

## The "Dumb Question" Method

**Question**: "Is it object or shadow?"

**Discovery**: All 7 Millennium Problems + twin primes = one hole.

That hole is the **discrete↔continuous interface**.

| Problem | Interface |
|---------|-----------|
| Riemann Hypothesis | Primes (discrete) ↔ Zeta zeros (continuous) |
| P vs NP | Algorithms (discrete) ↔ Complexity (continuous?) |
| Navier-Stokes | Fluid particles (discrete) ↔ Flow (continuous) |
| Yang-Mills | Gauge symmetry (continuous) ↔ Mass gap (discrete) |
| BSD Conjecture | Rational points (discrete) ↔ L-functions (continuous) |
| Hodge Conjecture | Algebraic cycles (discrete) ↔ Cohomology (continuous) |
| Twin Primes | Primes (discrete) ↔ Density (continuous) |

## Key Insight

**π appears when discrete structure is mediated by continuous symmetry.**

This is not metaphor—it's structural necessity.

## Applications to BlackRoad

1. **Agent Indexing**: Discrete agent IDs, continuous capability space
2. **PS-SHA∞**: Discrete hash, continuous identity evolution
3. **Coherence Metrics**: Discrete agreement counts, continuous similarity

## Open Questions

- Is there a "π-free" mathematics? What would it look like?
- How does n=π relate to the holographic principle?
- Can we formalize the "dumb question" method?
