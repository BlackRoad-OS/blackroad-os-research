# Z-Framework

## Definition
```
Z := yx - w
```

Where:
- **y** = output/response/effect
- **x** = input/stimulus/cause  
- **w** = target/setpoint/expectation
- **Z** = deviation/error/signal

## Interpretation

| Z Value | Meaning | Response |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Z = ∅ | Equilibrium | System stable, no adaptation needed |
| Z ≠ ∅ | Deviation | Triggers adaptation, learning, change |

## Unifying Principle

The same structure appears across domains:

| Domain | y | x | w | Z |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Control Theory | actual output | input gain | setpoint | error signal |
| Quantum Mechanics | measurement | operator | eigenvalue | deviation |
| Economics | price | supply×demand | equilibrium | market signal |
| Biology | phenotype | genotype×environment | fitness | selection pressure |
| AI/ML | prediction | model(input) | label | loss |

## Core Insight
```
∂(human + AI)/∂t
```

Division breaks the system. The feedback loop requires *product*, not separation.

## Applications to BlackRoad

1. **Agent Coordination**: Z measures coherence between agents
2. **Memory Consolidation**: Z triggers when new info conflicts with stored
3. **RoadChain Validation**: Z = ∅ means consensus achieved

## Open Questions

- How does Z relate to entropy production?
- Can Z be negative? What would that mean?
- Is there a "Z of Z" (meta-feedback)?
